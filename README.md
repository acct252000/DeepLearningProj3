This is my solution for Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Program project three, involving generating a Simpson's TV script using a RNN.

Thanks to the following for help:
 
 * [This Udacity message board answer](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/weights-and-biases-in-fully-connected-layer/232342) which helped with matching matrix shapes on the fully connected layer. 
 * [This Udacity message board answer](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/training-error-stuck-at-2/233886/5) which let me know I needed more epochs
 * [This stackoverflow answer from gg349](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2474015/getting-the-index-of-the-returned-max-or-min-item-using-max-min-on-a-list) which familiarized me with np.argmin from which I figured out np.argmax.
